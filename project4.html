      <h1>4-Way Smart Traffic System using STM32 Microcontroller</h1>
      <p class="meta">An Embedded Systems Based Traffic Control Project</p>
    </div>

    <div class="project-section">
      <p>This project implements a traffic light control system for a four-way intersection with integrated seven-segment display counting. It is designed to manage vehicle flow effectively by controlling traffic signals and providing digital countdown timers on each signal using seven-segment displays.</p>

      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>The system controls traffic lights at a four-way intersection in a timed sequence with red, yellow, and green signals for each direction. Along with the traffic lights, seven-segment displays show a countdown timer for signal change, helping drivers anticipate the next signal phase.</p>
      <p>The project is developed using microcontroller programming with GPIO pin control and delay functions to manage the timing and sequencing of signals.</p>

      <h2>Key Features</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Time-sequenced control of red, yellow, and green lights for each of the four directions.</li>
        <li>Seven-segment displays to show the countdown for 9 to 0 seconds.</li>
        <li>Use of GPIO pin programming for signal control.</li>
        <li>Efficient traffic flow management at the intersection.</li>
        <li>Visual countdown for better driver awareness and safety.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Working</h2>
      <p>Each direction receives a green, yellow, and red signal in a fixed time sequence controlled by the microcontroller.</p>
      <p>Digital countdown displayed on seven-segment displays counts down from 9 to 0 seconds.</p>
      <p>Delays between signal changes are implemented using delay functions in code.</p>
      <p>GPIO pins are toggled HIGH or LOW to turn ON/OFF LEDs representing traffic lights and seven-segment display segments.</p>

      <h2>System Components</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Microcontroller (such as STM32 or Arduino)</li>
        <li>LEDs for traffic lights (Red, Yellow, Green)</li>
        <li>Seven-segment displays (for countdown)</li>
        <li>Resistors, connecting wires, and power supply</li>
        <li>GPIO interface for controlling lights and displays</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Applications</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Traffic management in urban road intersections.</li>
        <li>Educational and demonstration projects for embedded systems and microcontroller programming.</li>
        <li>Automation of traffic signals in smart cities.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Future Scope</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Implementation of sensor-based adaptive traffic control.</li>
        <li>Integration with vehicle detection for intelligent signal timing.</li>
        <li>Remote monitoring and control using IoT.</li>
        <li>Addition of pedestrian signals and countdown.</li>
        <li>Expansion to multi-intersection coordinated control systems.</li>
      </ul>
