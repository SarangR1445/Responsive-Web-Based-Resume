      <h2>1. Crop Disease and Insect Detection Module (Jetson Nano with Flask Dashboard)</h2>
      <h3>Working Description</h3>
      <p>This module is powered by the NVIDIA Jetson Nano, a compact edge AI device capable of running deep learning models locally for real-time inference.</p>
      <p>It is connected to a Raspberry Pi 8MP camera module that captures high-resolution images of crops.</p>
      <p>A custom-trained YOLOv8 object detection model, optimized with TensorRT for Jetson Nano, detects 33 different classes of crop diseases and insect pests affecting crops like Blackgram, Cotton, and Soybean.</p>
      <p>The model processes images locally on the Jetson Nano without requiring internet connectivity, enabling usage in remote farm areas.</p>
      <p>Detection results (disease/insect type, confidence score, timestamp, and optional geolocation) are logged in CSV format for export and analysis.</p>
      <p>The Jetson Nano runs a Flask-based web server that hosts a user-friendly dashboard accessible from any device on the local network.</p>
      <p>The Flask web interface displays live camera feeds with detection bounding boxes and labels in real time.</p>
      <p>It also provides functionalities to start/stop the inference, view recent detection data, and export logs in CSV/Excel format.</p>
      <p>Cooling fans keep the Jetson Nano temperature optimized during continuous operation.</p>
      <p>A USB WiFi adapter optionally facilitates local network connectivity for remote monitoring on smartphones or laptops.</p>

      <h3>Workflow Summary</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The Jetson Nano powers up and initializes all software modules and camera.</li>
        <li>The Raspberry Pi camera captures the live video feed of the crops.</li>
        <li>Images are processed through the optimized YOLOv8 model running locally.</li>
        <li>Detected diseases and pest instances are highlighted on the live video feed shown on the Flask dashboard.</li>
        <li>Each detection result is recorded with relevant details in a CSV log file.</li>
        <li>Users can access the Flask web interface on devices connected to the same network, allowing easy real-time monitoring.</li>
        <li>The CSV logs can be exported for offline analysis to track trends and outbreaks over time.</li>

      <h2>2. Animal Intrusion Detection Module (ESP32-CAM with LoRa and Flask Dashboard)</h2>
      <h3>Working Description</h3>
      <p>An ESP32-CAM microcontroller equipped with an OV5640 5MP camera sensor captures images to detect wild animals in farm or forest areas.</p>
      <p>A TinyML animal detection model trained on Edge Impulse runs locally on the ESP32-CAM to identify animals such as tigers, leopards, bears, and elephants.</p>
      <p>On detection, the ESP32-CAM sends a unique animal code wirelessly using LoRa (Long Range) communication to a nearby ESP32 receiver microcontroller.</p>
      <p>The receiver ESP32 collects detections and relays them to a Flask web server hosting a real-time animal intrusion dashboard.</p>
      <p>The Flask web interface displays live detection alerts, showing animal type, timestamp, and location details.</p>
      <p>The dashboard supports historical logging and can trigger audible or visual alerts to immediately inform the farmer.</p>
      <p>This system operates independently of WiFi or cellular networks, making it ideal for remote agricultural fields.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>ESP32-CAM continuously captures images and performs local animal detection.</li>
        <li>Detected animal type is transmitted as a code over LoRa to the receiver ESP32.</li>
        <li>Receiver ESP32 sends received data to the Flask server on the local network.</li>
        <li>The Flask dashboard updates instantly with detection alerts, visualizing animal type and event time.</li>
