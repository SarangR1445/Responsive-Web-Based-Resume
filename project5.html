      <h1>IoT Based Pet Feeder</h1>
      <p class="meta">Smart Automated Feeding System Using ESP32 and Blynk IoT</p>
    </div>

    <div class="project-section">
      <p>The IoT-based pet feeder is a smart automated feeding system that allows pet owners to feed their pets remotely and on schedule via a mobile app controlled by Blynk IoT platform. Below is a detailed description of the working, components used, and how the system operates:</p>

      <h2>Detailed Description</h2>
      <h3>Working Principle</h3>
      <p>The pet feeder consists of a wooden stand on which a food container is fixed.</p>
      <p>A servo motor is attached to the wooden stand, which acts as a lid opener for the food container.</p>
      <p>Below the food container, there is a food tray where the pet can eat the dispensed food.</p>
      <p>The servo motor rotates to open or close the lid of the food container, controlling the release of food into the tray.</p>
      <p>The servo motor is connected to an ESP32 microcontroller that controls its operation.</p>
      <p>The ESP32 is programmed to communicate with the Blynk IoT platform, enabling the user to remotely control the servo motor via the Blynk mobile app.</p>
      <p>Features include scheduled feeding times, allowing users to set specific times for automatic feeding.</p>
      <p>Portion control is maintained by controlling the servo motor’s rotation duration or angle, ensuring consistent food amounts.</p>
      <p>Real-time notifications via the Blynk app keep the owner informed about feeding status or any malfunctions.</p>
      <p>The overall system enhances convenience, ensuring pets are fed on time even in the owner's absence, while prioritizing the pet's well-being.</p>

      </table>

      <h2>How it Works</h2>
      <p><b>Setup:</b> The food container and tray are mounted on a wooden stand with the servo motor attached to the container lid mechanism.</p>
      <p><b>Control:</b> The servo motor’s signal pin is connected to a GPIO pin on the ESP32. Power and ground connections complete the circuit.</p>
      <p><b>Firmware:</b> The ESP32 is flashed with Arduino code to connect to WiFi and the Blynk cloud platform. It listens for commands from the Blynk app to operate the servo.</p>

      <h3>Feeding Operation:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The user remotely opens the Blynk app and either triggers feed manually or sets a timer for scheduled feeding.</li>
        <li>At command, the ESP32 activates the servo motor to rotate, lifting or sliding the lid open momentarily, allowing food to drop into the tray.</li>
        <li>The motor then returns the lid to the closed position to prevent spillage or contamination.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Notifications:</b> The Blynk app receives feedback about feeding status and alerts the user if any fault occurs or feeding is complete.</p>
      <p><b>Schedule and Control:</b> Users can customize feeding schedules, portion sizes (by adjusting servo rotation time), and receive usage logs in realtime.</p>

      <h2>Benefits</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Enables pet feeding from anywhere with internet access.</li>
        <li>Scheduled automated feeding avoids missed meals.</li>
        <li>Portion control prevents overfeeding.</li>
        <li>Real-time notifications ensure pet is fed safely.</li>
        <li>Simple mechanical setup with widely available components.</li>
        <li>Scalable to multiple feeding times or integration with sensors.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="summary">This IoT pet feeder powered by ESP32 and controlled by the Blynk platform provides a reliable, convenient, and caring solution for modern pet owners to manage feeding remotely and efficiently.</p>
