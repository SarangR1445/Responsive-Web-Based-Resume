# Resume
As part of enhancing my front-end development skills, I created a modern and interactive resume webpage using HTML and CSS. The primary goal was to design a clean, responsive, and visually appealing digital resume that could effectively showcase my qualifications, skills, and projects in a structured format.
To start, I used semantic HTML elements such as " <section>, <table>, <ul>, <dl>, and <h1>â€“<h4> "to organize the content into meaningful blocks like Contact Information, Education, Technical Skills, Projects, and Certifications. This not only improved readability but also ensured the page adhered to accessibility and SEO standards.
On the CSS front, I applied various techniques to enhance the user experience. I implemented a fade-in and slide-up animation using @keyframes, which gave the entire resume a smooth, elegant entry effect upon page load. I used linear gradients and subtle box shadows to create depth and make the resume visually engaging. I also added hover effects to headings, links, and table rows to improve interactivity.
For the education section, I used a styled HTML table with alternating row colors and responsive behavior for better mobile viewing. I ensured a consistent font theme, padding, and margin throughout the document for a polished and professional layout.
The project and certification links were styled with animated underlines on hover, giving a modern touch to clickable elements. Additionally, I included media queries to ensure that the resume layout gracefully adapts to different screen sizes, especially tablets and mobile devices.
