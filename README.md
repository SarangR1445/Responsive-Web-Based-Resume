# Interactive Responsive Portfolio Website

The Interactive Responsive Portfolio Website is a personal web-based resume designed to present my professional profile, technical skills, and projects in a visually appealing and interactive manner. Built entirely using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the website combines smooth animations, responsive design principles, and a dark, tech-inspired theme to reflect my expertise as a MERN Stack and IoT Engineer.

## Project Overview

The website features a structured layout divided into key sections — About, Education, Skills, Projects, Experience, and Contact. Each section is styled with modern UI elements, subtle hover effects, and glowing highlights that give the site a futuristic appearance. Skills are represented as flexible, pill-shaped badges using flex-wrap, while projects are displayed in interactive cards with full descriptions and a “View” modal popup for detailed insights.
